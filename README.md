Sokoban is a puzzle game. The aim of this puzzle is to move boxes through a warehouse to a specific location.
The boxes can be pushed, but not pulled. The player must be careful and anticipate his movements to avoid not to jam a boxe against a wall or in a corner. A boxe can be placed on any any free space in the warehouse in the warehouse. Stowed can be moved again if the player needs to push it to a different needs to push it to a different location. 
The game ends when all the boxes have been placed in their designated their designated positions.

After our exciting sudoku and papyrus adventures, we're now turning our attention a new puzzle, the Sokoban! As our specialty is artificial intelligence, we decided to create a system for automatically solving Sokoban grids.
